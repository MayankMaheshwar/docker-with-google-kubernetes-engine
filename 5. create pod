A Kubernetes pod is a group of containers tied together for administration and networking purposes. It can contain single or multiple containers. Here you'll use one container built with your Node.js image stored in your private container registry. It will serve content on port 8080.

kubectl create deployment hello-node \
    --image=gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/hello-node:v1


As you can see, you've created a deployment object. Deployments are the recommended way to create and scale pods. Here, a new deployment manages a single pod replica running the hello-node:v1 image.
